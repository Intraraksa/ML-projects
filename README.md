# Machine Learning project
These machine learning project was created from my personally interesting in AI,Machine learning and Data science

**Classification project**:
- [Credit card Fraud detection](https://github.com/Intraraksa/ML-projects/blob/master/Credit_fraud.ipynb) The Classification Fraud and Non Fraud by Machine learning include Data visualization
