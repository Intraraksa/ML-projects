       "\"Context\\nAfter watching Somm (a documentary on master sommeliers) I wondered how I could create a predictive model to identify wines through blind tasting like a master sommelier would. The first step in this journey was gathering some data to train a model. I plan to use deep learning to predict the wine variety using words in the description/review. The model still won't be able to taste the wine, but theoretically it could identify the wine based on a description that a sommelier could give. If anyone has any ideas on how to accomplish this, please post them!\\nContent\\nThe data consists of 10 fields:\\nPoints: the number of points WineEnthusiast rated the wine on a scale of 1-100 (though they say they only post reviews for wines that score >=80)\\nTitle: the title of the wine review, which often contains the vintage if you're interested in extracting that feature\\nVariety: the type of grapes used to make the wine (ie Pinot Noir)\\nDescription: a few sentences from a sommelier describing the wine's taste, smell, look, feel, etc.\\nCountry: the country that the wine is from\\nProvince: the province or state that the wine is from\\nRegion 1: the wine growing area in a province or state (ie Napa)\\nRegion 2: sometimes there are more specific regions specified within a wine growing area (ie Rutherford inside the Napa Valley), but this value can sometimes be blank\\nWinery: the winery that made the wine\\nDesignation: the vineyard within the winery where the grapes that made the wine are from\\nPrice: the cost for a bottle of the wine\\nTaster Name: name of the person who tasted and reviewed the wine\\nTaster Twitter Handle: Twitter handle for the person who tasted and reviewed the wine\\nAcknowledgements\\nThe data was scraped from WineEnthusiast during the week of June 15th, 2017. The code for the scraper can be found here if you have any more specific questions about data collection that I didn't address.\\nUPDATE 11/24/2017 After feedback from users of the dataset I scraped the reviews again on November 22nd, 2017. This time around I collected the title of each review, which you can parse the year out of, the tasters name, and the taster's Twitter handle. This should also fix the duplicate entry issue.\\nInspiration\\nI think that this dataset offers some great opportunities for sentiment analysis and other text related predictive models. My overall goal is to create a model that can identify the variety, winery, and location of a wine based on a description. If anyone has any ideas, breakthroughs, or other interesting insights/models please post them.\""
