# Heart disease classification

This project is published on Kaggle. You can download dataset via [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)

Originally, The dataset contain subset data to analysis Heart Disease. But in this dataset. The publisher provide the necessary subset for this project.
That contain only 14 subset to use in this project.

However, We also use feature engineer technic to feature selection more data.

In this Notebook We use correlation matrix to drop off the unsignificant feature.

Finally, We build the experiment to find out the best performance model by GridsearchCV and pick the best model to find out the best parameter afterward.
